          <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
          <p>
            The common interest that members of the Association share is to
            inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
            Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
            whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
            action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
            accomplishments or standing.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong> DIMENSIONS</strong>.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
              external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width
              and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
              used by teams under 12 and older.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the
              competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
              districts or associations participating in the state competition
              program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
              minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
              will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
              recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
              dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
              associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
              required to play all their games away.
            </li>

                  progressively larger.
                </li>
                <li>
